 * The {@linkplain DataFrame} (with {@code m} rows) and {@linkplain Series} (of length {@code m})
 * are partitioned into {@code m} partitions. At each iteration {@code m-1} data points are returned
 * as the training set and {@code 1} data point as the validation set. All data points are used as
 * validation points exactly once.
