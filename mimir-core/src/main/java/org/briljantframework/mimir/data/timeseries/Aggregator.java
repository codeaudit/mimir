 * Performs an aggregation of a particular data series, represented as a vector. For example, one

 * to divide the vector into {@code 3} equally sized bins: {@code [1,2], [3,4], [5,6]}. These bins
 * can then be aggregated by, e.g., averaging to produce the vector {@code [1.5, 3.5, 5.5]}.

 * The {@link #partialAggregate(org.briljantframework.data.series.Series)}, takes an input vector
 * and produces a mutable {@link org.briljantframework.data.series.Series.Builder} for futher
 * transformation. The {@link #aggregate(org.briljantframework.data.series.Series)} produces a new,
 * aggregated, vector.
